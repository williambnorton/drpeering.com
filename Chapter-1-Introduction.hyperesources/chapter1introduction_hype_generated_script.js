I had already been upgraded, so the flight was starting very well! The gate agent called me forward to tell me that my already-delayed flight would most likely be cancelled, and that she would like to rebook me on the next flight to LA, about 10 gates down the terminal. \u201cYour flight will leave in 15 minutes.\u201d I asked that my work colleagues be rebooked as well and she obliged, so the three of us walked to the new gate and boarded the plane, just in time for it to depart. Or so we thought.\n</p><p>\nThe flight didn\u2019t take off on time. For 30 minutes or so we witnessed some very stressed people getting on the plane, disheveled and complaining. These people were clearly distressed. After a dozen or so people headed back into coach, several came back to the front of the plane saying that their assigned seat was taken and they plopped down in first class. The flight attendant said, \u201cOK, just sit anywhere. We have to leave now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nIf you have ever flown first class, you know that you never hear a flight attendant say, \u201cjust sit anywhere.\u201d In any case, the door closed and we took off. I learned the story from the agitated people, after we were in the air.\n</p><p>\nAs it turns out, shortly after we had left the original gate, the gate agent announced the cancellation of that first flight. She made the following announcement:\n</p><p>\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that flight 234 to Los Angeles has been cancelled. We will work to rebook you on a later flight, but in the meantime, we have a flight to L.A. leaving in 10 minutes at gate 34, about a 5-minute walk from here. We can take the first 15 of you. If you would please progress to gate 34 in a calm and orderly fashion we will handle boarding or rebooking there. Please proceed to gate 34 in a calm and orderly fashion.\u201d\n</p>\n<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>\n<p>Given this context, can you guess what happened? Isn\u2019t it predictable what would happen?</p>\n<p>Sure enough, the 154 passengers rushed to gate 34, many in a slight panic. The line developed at gate 34 and the gate agent processed people in order until people started circling around the gate agent to plead their special case. \u201cMy band plays tonight,\u201d \u201cI am already late to my sister\u2019s wedding,\u201d \u201cMy business meeting starts an hour after I land,\u201d \u201cI cannot be late to my next flight,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p>The orderly line turned into a \u201cmake-your-case\u201d mob fest. Those who were the most convincing and/or aggressive were given a boarding pass, perhaps because the agent just wanted to get rid of them. Of course rewarding this behavior led to louder and more aggressive acts to get to the front of the line. Imagine the situation. The notion of fairness, engraved in our minds, kicked in and led to the airport police and the Detroit police being summoned to the gate to calm things down and restore order.\n</p><p>\nWho bears responsibility for this ugly scene?

The second time, perhaps you make different mistakes. After a few dozen more times, it is rare to make a mistake, and the process becomes systematic. With even more experience, you master a systematic process. In this book I will present three \u201cplaybooks\u201d that demonstrate some mastery in the peering domain.</p>\n\n<p>The tactics in the playbooks are not necessarily recommended tactics, or best practices. Rather, they are actual tactics (both good and bad, ethical and otherwise) that are in use in the real world. They are presented here to enable you to understand the interconnection paradigm by exploring the various manipulations of the system. Understanding the manipulations of the system helps us better understand the system.</p>\n",j:"absolute",x:"scroll",k:"div",y:"preserve",z:1,aS:8,aT:8,a:16,b:0}}},{o:"134",p:"600px",cA:false,a:100,Z:2500,Y:768,c:"#F9FFFA",L:[],bY:1,d:768,U:{},T:{kTimelineDefaultIdentifier:{i:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",n:"Main Timeline",z:0,b:[],a:[],f:30}},bZ:180,G:{a:[{j:"http://drpeering.com",p:5,k:false}]},O:["155"],n:"iPad Portrait","_":1,v:{"155":{G:"#000000",aU:8,c:693,bS:71,aV:8,d:2462,r:"inline",s:"'Times New Roman',Times,Baskerville,Serif",t:16,Z:"break-word",w:"\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><font size=\"3\">The Internet Peering Playbook</font></h2><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36px;\"><br></span></h2><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36px;\">Chapter 1 - Introduction</span></h2><h2><br></h2><div><br></div><h2><br></h2><h2>Context is Important</h2>\n<p>I was waiting in the gate area for my flight from Detroit to Los Angeles.

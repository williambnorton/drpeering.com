  <h3>...about The Internet Peering Playbook</h3>
  <p class="longquote">&quot;I would like to state how beautifully your book covers what one needs in the industry and also in the academia. ...it is a bible to prepare the business case proposals and win the negotiations!&quot;</p>
  <p class="attribution">Mehrdad Khakparaghi</p>
  <p><span class="longquote">“This book really reveals the true nature of the Internet. It gives a practical view about the Internet market which even many engineers developing Internet protocols are lacking. This is the number one book  to learn the ways of which companies create interconnections in the Internet to serve their customers. Sometimes this requires even a rigorous fight for better performance and lower costs.”</span></p>

  <p class="longquote">&quot;If you have attended any Industry networking forums you've probably met Bill Norton. Leveraging his extensive experience in the industry he has managed to write what I think is the most (and perhaps only?) comprehensive Internet peering practicum out there. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the many aspects involved in peering relationships from the technical to the economics of it. The book is very well structured throughout and BGP is not a requirement to dive into the material. I would definitely recommend it.&quot;</p>

  <p class="longquote">End users see the Internet as a seamless, global, ubiquitous communication medium. Behind the scenes, there are many individual networks, owned and operated by different corporate, institutional, and governmental entities. ISPs connect their networks to each other in order to exchange traffic between their customers and customers of other ISPs. Since there is no single ISP that has its cables connected to all computers in the world, ISP interconnection is the glue that holds the Internet together. </p>
  <p class="longquote">As a rule, textbooks on computer networks are focused on protocols, switching, routing, addressing, and internetworking issues. In contrast, the focus of &quot;The Internet Peering Playbook&quot; is on technical and business aspects of ISP interconnection. In other words, it addresses the question of what mechanisms are used to enable owners and operators of different networks to collaborate as business entities in the provision of seamless end-to-end Internet connectivity to all of their customers. </p>
  <p class="longquote">The book is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of ISP interconnection and traffic exchange strategies. It also includes numerous real-world examples and case studies, derived from the author’s own experience in Internet transit and peering, and the lessons learned there. This book will be useful to all readers without exception: for network administrators and engineers, researchers and practitioners, teachers and students. </p>
